# What is this?
This is a project to build a fictional 16 bit console. It will have a limited amount of memory (lets say 1MB), 
a simple instruction set to make it easy to program, an easy way to share and load games and a screen keyboard and mouse interface.

# Specs of computer
The computer will have 1 MB of addressible ram. An interface for a cartridge and non volitile storage and a cpu with a limited speed.

# Instruction Set
Details still to be determined but I am thinking of having a very simple instruction set.
