## What is this?
This is a project to build a fictional 16 bit console. It will have a limited amount of memory (lets say 1MB), 
a simple instruction set to make it easy to program, an easy way to share and load games and a screen keyboard and mouse interface.

## Specs of computer
The computer will have 1 MB of addressable ram. An interface for a cartridge and non volatile storage and a cpu with a limited speed.

## Instruction Set
Details still to be determined but I am thinking of having a very simple instruction set. 

## Opcode Format:
A full instruction consists of (except for jmp) two bytes. The first specifies the instruction used and the second byte are 
the arguments of the instruction

## Registers
There are 4 general purpose registers ra rb rc and rd. These registers can be used for anything. There are two special purpose
registers, sp the stack pointer and of, the offset register.

| Register                 | Opcode (in binary) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| ra (general purpose)     |   000              |
| rb (general purpose)     |   001              |
| rc (general purpose      |   010              |
| rd (general purpose)     |   011              |
| sp (stack pointer)       |   100              |
| of (offset register)     |   101              |
| ip (instruction pointer) |   110              |
| unused                   |   111              |

## Instructions Detail

# term
This just terminates the machine.
```
Opcode: 
0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000
````

# push
Pushes reg onto stack. sp is incremented by two bytes (by two)
```
opcode:
0000 0001   0000 [reg]
